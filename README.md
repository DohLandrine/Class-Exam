## Student Feedback Collection System
The university administration wants a streamlined way to gather student feedback on courses and campus services. Students should be able to submit anonymous feedback and rate different aspects of their university experience.The system should allow for both structured surveys and open-ended feedback. It should provide analytics tools for administrators to identify trends and areas for improvement. The system should also close the feedback loop by allowing departments to respond to feedback and showcase improvements made based on student input.
